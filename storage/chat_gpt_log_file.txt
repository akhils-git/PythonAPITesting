Question : explain_petrol_engine_working
Answer:The petrol engine uses a four-stroke cycle. The piston starts at the top, the intake valve opens, and the piston moves down to draw in a mixture of petrol and air. The piston then moves back up to compress the mixture. The spark plug ignites the mixture and the piston is forced back down by the expanding gases. The exhaust valve then opens and the piston moves back up to expel the exhaust gases.
